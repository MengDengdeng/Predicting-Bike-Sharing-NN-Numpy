# Bike Sharing Prediction
This project built a neural network using [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) to predict daily bike rental ridership with given features.

## Install
The project requires **Python** and the following libraries installed:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

It will also require a software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Code
* Template code is provided in the `Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb` notebook file.
* `Neural_Network.py`, `nn_testing.py` python file, dataset file in Bike-Sharing-Dataset folder are mandatory to complete the project. 

Note that the code included in `nn_testing.py` is meant to test the network architecture in `Neural_Netwrok.py`. 

## Run

Run `Neural_Network.py` before run `Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb`

## Data
#### Features
* Featues are explained in the `ipynb` file
